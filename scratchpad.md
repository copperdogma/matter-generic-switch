## ✅ COMPLETED PROJECT STATUS

**Current Phase:** Project Complete + Documentation Cleanup
- ✅ Project Completed: Matter-enabled occupancy sensor with ESP32-C3 and HC-SR501 PIR sensor.
- ✅ Successfully integrated with Apple Home via Matter protocol using QR codes.
- ✅ Hardware assembled and deployed in repurposed HDD enclosure
- ✅ Documentation updated and cleaned up (removed ESP32-S3 references, focused on ESP32-C3)

### Final Status
- Successfully implemented a functional Matter occupancy sensor that integrates with Apple Home
- Device reliably reports occupancy state changes and respects configured delay settings
- Hardware and software components fully tested and documented
- Project documentation completed including circuit diagram and assembly instructions
- Most planned features implemented, with known limitations documented

### Detailed Documentation
- Complete circuit diagram available at [docs/circuit_diagram.md](docs/circuit_diagram.md)
- Final hardware uses ESP32-C3 SuperMini with HC-SR501 PIR sensor and status LED
- Assembly uses direct Dupont connections with hot glue reinforcement for stability
- Housed in repurposed HDD enclosure with appropriate openings for sensor and LED

### Hardware Configuration

**Final Hardware:**
*   Microcontroller: **ESP32-C3 SuperMini**
*   PIR Sensor: HC-SR501
*   Status LED: 5mm LED with 220Ω resistor
*   Power: USB-C to ESP32-C3 SuperMini

**Pin Configuration:**

*   **PIR Sensor Data Pin (`PIR_SENSOR_GPIO_NUM`):** GPIO 3
*   **LED Indicator Pin (`LED_INDICATOR_GPIO_NUM`):** GPIO 5

**Connections:**

1.  **HC-SR501 VCC (Power)**: Connected to ESP32-C3 5V pin
2.  **HC-SR501 GND (Ground)**: Connected to ESP32-C3 GND pin
3.  **HC-SR501 OUT (Signal Output)**: Connected to ESP32-C3 GPIO 3
4.  **Status LED Anode (+)**: Connected through 220Ω resistor to ESP32-C3 GPIO 5
5.  **Status LED Cathode (-)**: Connected to ESP32-C3 GND pin

**Powering the System:**
*   Via USB-C connection to the ESP32-C3 SuperMini board

### Known Limitations

1. **Matter Controller Compatibility**:
   - Tested primarily with Apple Home
   - Integration with other Matter controllers not fully verified

2. **Console Warnings**:
   - Non-critical warnings in console (`Config is NULL or mandatory features are missing`)
   - RTC clock warnings (`GetClock_RealTimeMS() API: 6c`) are known issues in ESP-Matter

3. **Configuration Interface**:
   - Occupancy delay can be adjusted via Matter attributes, but Apple Home UI does not expose this setting
   - For custom delay configuration, alternative Matter controllers would be needed

4. **Performance**:
   - 15-minute default delay is suitable for most home automation scenarios
   - Motion detection range and sensitivity depend on PIR sensor adjustment and positioning

### Future Enhancement Possibilities

- OTA update capability for firmware updates
- Advanced status indicators (multi-color LED patterns)
- Integration with additional Matter controllers
- Battery-powered operation (would require sleep mode implementation)
- Weather-resistant enclosure for outdoor use
- Matter security hardening beyond default implementation
