### Hardware Components
- ESP32-S3 WROOM module
  - Dual-core 240 MHz processor
  - 512KB SRAM for Matter stack
  - 8MB Flash for firmware/storage
  - Dual USB-C ports
  - 5V and 3.3V power output capabilities
- HC-SR501 PIR sensor
  - Maximum sensitivity for range
  - ~120Â° detection angle
  - Optimized mounting for coverage
  - Powered directly from ESP32's 5V pin
  - Initial Test Results (20250117):
    - Configuration:
      - Sensitivity: Medium (potentiometer at middle position)
      - Time delay: Minimum (fully counter-clockwise)
      - Trigger mode: 'H' for repeatable triggers
    - Signal Characteristics:
      - Baseline: 0V (no motion)
      - Trigger: Clean 3.3V spike on motion detection
      - Duration: 1-2 seconds per trigger
      - Block time: ~2.5s between triggers (built-in lockout period)
    - Validation:
      - Output voltage compatible with ESP32 GPIO (3.3V)
      - Clean signal transitions with minimal noise
      - Consistent triggering behavior
      - Built-in debouncing via block time
